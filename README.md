# Campus Route Optimizer

A Python-based campus navigation tool that calculates the shortest walking path between buildings using Dijkstra’s Algorithm.

## Features
- Graph-based campus map modeling
- Shortest-path calculation using Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- Command-line interface for user interaction
- Weighted edges representing walking time between buildings

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Graph Theory
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm

## How to Run

python main.py
Type in the name of the given buildings or copy and paste from the given names

## Example

Starting location: Student Center
Ending location: Blount Towers

Output:
Shortest Path:
Student Center → Earl S. Richardson Library → Cummings Hall → Blount Towers
Total Cost: 18 minutes
